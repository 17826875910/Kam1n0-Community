## Migrate repository from the previous version

All the repositories created before Kam1n0 engine version 1.x.x are no longer supported. In order to migrate the old repository, you need to create a new repository and re-index all the binary files at this moment. If you need a script to upgrade existing repository, let us known and open an issue. Then we will prioritize this task.
